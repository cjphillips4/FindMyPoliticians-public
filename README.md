I created this web app during the summer of 2022 as a personal side project to teach myself React as well as other web development technologies.  Find My Politicians allows a user to enter any address in the United States and will then return a list of all politicians representing them, from the local/township level up to the federal level.  It provides users with a variety of ways to contact their representitives when a politician is selected from the list.  The goal of Find My Politicians is to encourage active participation in our democracy besides merely voting and to better educate citizens on the wide variety of positions representing them.
